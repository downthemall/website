    But DownThemAll! 2.0 will be Firefox 4 compatible!\n\n\
    The 2.0 Beta releases we did so far already declared support for some older Firefox betas. We won\xE2\x80\x99t however release a new beta version with every Firefox beta. Furthermore the DownThemAll! 2.0 Betas won\xE2\x80\x99t be upgraded to newer Betas (you have to manually install a new beta, or wait for the official 2.0 release).\n\n\
    If you\xE2\x80\x99d like to use DownThemAll! with current Firefox 4 Betas, then please install our:\n \"Nightly Builds\":http://bugs.code.downthemall.net/trac/wiki/NightlyBuilds !\n\
    Those have the advantage that they are updated once every night, so you\xE2\x80\x99ll always get the most recent stuff with automatic updates. This can, on the other hand, be a downside as well, as those builds can contain more bugs, however they were pretty stable recently. ;) Of course, Firefox 3.6 users are welcomed to try the Nightly Builds as well.\n\n\

- :title: DownThemAll! 1.1.9 released
  :posted_at: 2010-03-26T00:00:00+00:00
  :content: "We released DownThemAll! Version 1.1.9, which is a maintenance and bugfix release.\n\n\
    We fixes some rare situation where the preallocator did not kick in (resuming a not fully allocated file), which caused even worse Firefox hangs than without preallocator.\n\
    We also fixed some issues with using DownThemAll! in combination with a dark theme (some dark themes might still not work in some parts; we either fix issues ourselves or notify the theme authors as issues become known).\n\
    Then there were a few reports that Firefox might not correctly start up after installation, which seems to be caused by the initial notice window we shown after fresh installations or major upgrades. We disabled this for now, to see how that goes.\n\
    Version 2.0 will not have any such window anymore; instead we\xE2\x80\x99re in the process to create a first run page detailing some basic usage.\n\
    Windows 7 users observing high memory usage should also have a look at the release notes; We detail the situation there and link the hotfix Microsoft issued.\n\n\

    The competition is very strong, which makes it even more remarkable that we got nominated, and we certainly cannot beat Adblock Plus (which got my vote; don\xE2\x80\x99t vote for yourself). But being in the top 5 already is a great sign of your, the DownThemAll! users, support and trust.\n\
    Thank you very much for that!\n\n\

- :title: No Google Chrome support
  :posted_at: 2009-12-10T00:00:00+00:00
  :content: "As more and more people are asking us for a DownThemAll! version for Google Chrome:\n\n\
    We won\xE2\x80\x99t support Google Chrome (and Chromium for that matter) in the near future, if ever.\n\n\
    There are multiple reasons not to support Google Chrome (at the moment):\n\n\
    * While support for _some_ types of extensions was added to Chrome just recently, the extension system in Chrome simply doesn\xE2\x80\x99t cut it. It is only very limited in what you can do. *Right now there is no way to port dTa over without losing the majority of functionality* .\n\
    * Even if there were the technical means to port dTa! to Google Chrome, we still wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have the time and resources to support it.Right now we\xE2\x80\x99re in the middle of university studies or only recently completed our degrees and hence need to \xE2\x80\x9Csettle\xE2\x80\x9D for a real-life work. Some of us are now family men.\n\n\
    As you clearly noticed the number of dTa! releases was always low with only a major release once a year. Due to these time constraints we don\xE2\x80\x99t think we can handle supporting yet another application.\n\n\n\
    * We are not yet sure about the privacy in Chrome. Chrome itself is closed source (not to confuse with the Chromium basis, which is open source) and it can only be guessed what happens \xE2\x80\x9Cbehind the scenes\xE2\x80\x9D. Google Chrome is known to transmit data back to the google servers. This kept us away from using Google Chrome, although we watched the progress made so far.\n\
    * Lastly, we are still Mozilla supporters.\n\
    While this surely won\xE2\x80\x99t keep us away from a Chrome port, it surely does not provide us with a lot of motivation to code for Google Chrome.\n\
    Not only is Firefox the superior browser in our opinion, the Mozilla Foundation and Co. and the great people in the Mozilla community \xE2\x80\x93 developers, translators, designers, users and all the other folks \xE2\x80\x93 and the truly \xE2\x80\x9Copen\xE2\x80\x9D mindset keep us in the Mozilla base. ;)\n\n\
    Thanks for your interest in a dTa! version for Google Chrome, but we have to pass at this time.\n\
    Nils\n\n\
    Update 2009/12/11:\n\
    Here is Giorgio Maones take on the Chrome extension system, with some explanation why there are no NoScript or decent ad-blockers for Google Chrome yet:\n\n\

- :title: Can I trust NoScript any longer?
  :posted_at: 2009-05-02T00:00:00+00:00
  :content: "Giorgio Maone, the author of NoScript, recently released an update that actively and intensionally crippled Adblock Plus.\n\
    The piece of code responsible was reportedly obfuscated to make it hard to find and analyze.\n\
    Read the \"post of Wladmir Palant\":http://adblockplus.org/blog/attention-noscript-users , the author of Adblock Plus, and what \"Giorgio has to say\":http://forums.informaction.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=877 .\n\n\
    Giorgio later reverted these changes (under pressure it seems), but started to forcefully add a filter subscription to white-list his domains, without asking for user consent, of course.\n\
    The latest release at least lets the user \xE2\x80\x9Copt-out\xE2\x80\x9D.\n\n\
    Frankly, I find both, first the intensional crippling of Adblock Plus, and then adding some filter subscription without consent, disturbing and unacceptable.\n\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99d expect Giorgio to stop defending his previous actions and instead admitting his wrong-doing and issuing a public apology to the users.\n\n\
    Nils\n\n *Update, 2nd of May:* \n\n\
    From the NoScript FAQ\n\n\
    bq. Version 1.9.2.6 (released May the 1st 2009) automatically and permanently removes the filter on startup, no questions asked. This decision has been taken as a sign of good will and apologizes, after the lack of a prompt asking beforehand prior version 1.9.2.5 caused complaints and controversy in the Mozilla community.\n\n\n\n\
    So the filter subscription is gone again, and there is kind of an apology.\n\
    However it still feels, after reading this, that Giorgio didn\xE2\x80\x99t get the point, exactly.\n\
    Why didn\xE2\x80\x99t he address the initial \xE2\x80\x9Cpatching\xE2\x80\x9D of Adblock Plus code?\n\
    Is it just because of the complaints and \xE2\x80\x9Ccontroversy\xE2\x80\x9D that he reverted the changes again, or does he now see how he betrayed user trust?\n\n\
    I don\xE2\x80\x99t have any problem with NoScript adding a filter subscription, as long as it is in a transparent manner and the user can properly opt-out, far better even has to opt-in.\n\
    A lot of other users seem to agree. If there was some choice along the lines of \xE2\x80\x9CWant to support NoScript by allowing to displayed Noscript website ads in Adblock Plus\xE2\x80\x9D (Yes/No), a lot of users would have chosen yes.\n\n *Update2, 2nd of May:* \n\
    Seems Giorgio indeed got the point. See this \"forum post\":http://forums.informaction.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=877&start=150#p3471 .\n\
    Still makes me wonder how it can happen that a \xE2\x80\x9Csecurity\xE2\x80\x9D software developer implements and releases code that easily can be classified as \xE2\x80\x9Cmalware\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\xA6"
